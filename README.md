# Skin_cancer_project
Developed deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2) for early skin cancer detection using the HAM10000 dataset. Implemented data preprocessing, augmentation, and transfer learning to enhance accuracy above 85%. Conducted comparative analysis to determine the most effective model.
